<h1 align="center">DiskProvision: Legacy Submodule</h1>
<h4 align="center">Allows the creation, management, and updating of the OpenCore EFI partition for your DKVM.</h4>

## Development Status - ``Deprecated``

Currently no longer being maintained. Included in the repository as users reported issues with the executable variant of DiskProvision. If you're running into any problems, feel free to do any of the following manually. All information required to do so is included here! Enjoy.

## About

``init.sh`` automates the process of creating and setting up an OpenCore.img disk image for use with QEMU, as well as mounting it. It also comes with seperate ``mount.sh`` and ``unmount.sh`` to easily modify the contents. This submodule performs the following actions:

- Creates an OpenCore.img disk image file.
- Loads the nbd kernel module if not already loaded.
- Connects /dev/nbd0 to the OpenCore.img disk image.
- Formats the connected device as FAT32 with the label "OPENCORE".
- Mounts the formatted device to the mnt directory with the user as the owner.
- Optionally unmounts the image when done.

## Requirements

* Packages/Dependencies:
  * qemu-img
  * qemu-utils
  * modprobe
  * mkfs.fat (usually provided by dosfstools)

## Usage

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script files.

1. Ensure the scripts have executable permissions:

``chmod +x init.sh mount.sh unmount.sh``

2. You can now create a blank OC EFI .img by issuing:

``./init.sh``

example output:

```
[royalgraphx@hypervisor DiskProvision]$ ./init.sh 
Formatting 'OpenCore.img', fmt=raw size=1073741824
OpenCore Image created!
Mounting and formatting...
nbd module is already loaded. Proceeding...
[sudo] password for royalgraphx: 
/dev/nbd0 disconnected
mkfs.fat 4.2 (2021-01-31)
Formatting complete!
Created 'mnt' directory.
Image mounted to 'mnt' directory with desired ownership successfully.
Do you want to unmount the image? (y/n): n
Image kept mounted. Remember to unmount it later when you're done.
[royalgraphx@hypervisor DiskProvision]$
```

## Mounting to edit OC EFI

As expected, the tools do as described. Here is some example output.

1. Mounting the OpenCore.img to edit contents:

``./mount.sh``

example output:

```
[royalgraphx@hypervisor DiskProvision]$ ./mount.sh 
nbd module is already loaded. Proceeding...
/dev/nbd0 is already connected. Disconnecting...
/dev/nbd0 disconnected
Connected /dev/nbd0.
Created 'mnt' directory.
Image mounted to 'mnt' directory with desired ownership successfully.
[royalgraphx@hypervisor OpenCore]$ ls -l
total 2088
-rwxr-xr-x 1 royalgraphx royalgraphx       1920 Jun 17 20:09 init.sh
drwxr-xr-x 2 royalgraphx royalgraphx       4096 Dec 31  1969 mnt

-rwxr-xr-x 1 royalgraphx royalgraphx        269 Jun 17 19:54 unmount.sh
[royalgraphx@hypervisor DiskProvision]$
```

2. Unmounting the OpenCore.img:

``./unmount.sh``

Example output:

```
[royalgraphx@hypervisor DiskProvision]$ ./unmount.sh 
Image unmounted.
/dev/nbd0 disconnected
NBD device disconnected.
Directory 'mnt' removed.
[royalgraphx@hypervisor DiskProvision]$ ls -l
total 2084
-rwxr-xr-x 1 royalgraphx royalgraphx       1920 Jun 17 20:09 init.sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 royalgraphx royalgraphx        820 Jun 17 20:04 mount.sh

```

# Example usecases

## Easily mounting and modifying

<h3 align="center">After running the init.sh, the user has a new mnt folder that acts as the mount point.</h3>

## Adding to Virt-Manager

<h3 align="center">Make sure you add it as a VirtIO drive, with no cache and unmap.</h3>
